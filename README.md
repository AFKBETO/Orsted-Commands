# Orsted-Commands

This is a collection of commands for the Orsted bot, a Discord bot project using Deno. The commands are organized into different categories, each with its own functionality.

The commands in ./commands/secretCommands/ are from a private repository and are not included in this repository. They are used for testing purposes and are not intended for public use.

Using ``git clone --recurse-submodules`` or ``git submodule update --init`` from the main repository should be sufficient to run this submodule.
